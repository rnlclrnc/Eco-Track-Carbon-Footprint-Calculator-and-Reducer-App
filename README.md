# Eco-Track-Carbon-Footprint-Calculator-and-Reducer-App


**PROJECT OVERVIEW
**

EcoTrack is a user-friendly application designed to help individuals and businesses measure and reduce their carbon footprint. The app estimates carbon emissions based on various activities like transportation, energy usage, diet, and shopping. It then provides actionable recommendations for reducing emissions and offers a carbon offset marketplace for users who wish to neutralize their environmental impact.
EcoTrack aligns with the principles of sustainability by promoting eco-friendly habits, educating users on the environmental impact of their choices, and helping them track progress towards a greener lifestyle. By utilizing data analysis and machine learning, EcoTrack offers precise insights and personalized reduction plans.

**EXPLANATION OF HOW OOP PRINCIPLES WERE APPLIED
**

**Encapsulation:**
Data (e.g., user inputs, emission values) is stored within classes and accessed through methods to ensure secure and organized management.

**Inheritance:**
Specialized classes inherit common properties and methods from base classes.

**Polymorphism:**
Overridden methods allow the program to handle similar operations differently based on context.

**Abstraction:**
Unnecessary implementation details are hidden, providing a simplified interface.
